This repository publishes the single container image for the Mushroom Pi system. One image serves the NestJS API and the built React dashboard on port 3000, targeting a Raspberry Pi 3 (1GB).

The image is published to **`ghcr.io/mushroom-pi/mushpi`**. This repo also owns the compose service definition and the release manifest that pin which component versions ship together.

## Run it

The self-hosting path — no build step, no agent tooling:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mushroom-pi/mushpi-ops.git mushpi-ops
cd mushpi-ops
cp .env.example .env       # set PICO_ANNOUNCE_SECRET
docker compose up -d
```

Open port 3000. This pulls the published image — you never build locally. The compose file reads optional variables from `.env`: `MUSHPI_DATA_DIR` (the host directory holding the database, images and logs; defaults to `./mushpi-data`) and `MUSHPI_IMAGE_TAG` (the image tag to pull; defaults to `latest`). `.env` also carries a few optional server runtime options — for example, uncommenting the `MAX_REQUESTS` / `MAX_REQUESTS_TIME` pair from `.env.example` opts the server into request throttling. Full deployment instructions (SD-card provisioning, first boot, Pico unit setup, the update workflow, backups, Tailscale remote access) are in `DEPLOYMENT.md`.

The local build toggle `docker-compose.override.yml` is deliberately untracked, so it never appears in a clone: a plain `docker compose up -d` always pulls the published image. Maintainers who want to build from source keep a local copy of that override.

## What's here

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `docker-compose.yml` | Compose service that pulls the published image |
| `Dockerfile` | Builds the single-container image from this repo's root as context |
| `.env.example` | Environment template (`PICO_ANNOUNCE_SECRET` plus optional overrides) |
| `release.json` | Release manifest — the component versions in this bundle |
| `scripts/verify-release.sh` | Checks the manifest against the committed component versions |
| `.github/workflows/publish.yml` | CI: builds and pushes the image on `main` and `v*` tags |
| `DEPLOYMENT.md` | How to run it (operators) |
| `MAINTAINING.md` | How to build and release it (maintainers) |

Application code lives in the sibling repositories `mushpi-server`, `mushpi-client`, `mushpi-grow`, and `mushpi-mock` — this repo holds the packaging layer only.

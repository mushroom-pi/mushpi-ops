# mushpi-ops — Reference (On-Demand)

Long-tail gotchas for the release/packaging layer. **Load only when the task touches these areas** — do not read on every spawn. The always-loaded [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) holds the file map, the sibling-materialization model, verification commands, and core conventions.

Topics covered here: build-context layout · Yarn Berry 4 / Corepack · `better-sqlite3` native build · client API regeneration + `tsc` gate · entrypoint & runtime details · rate limiting (`MAX_REQUESTS` / `MAX_REQUESTS_TIME`) · `release.json` in the build context · tag & CI semantics · dev / pre-release image builds · shared build action · local verify/build prerequisites · `docker-compose.override.yml` & local `.env`.

## Build-context layout

- The Docker build context is **this repository's root** (the `mushpi-ops` checkout). The `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.dockerignore`, `.env.example`, and `.github/workflows/publish.yml` all live here; `COPY mushpi-server/...` and `COPY mushpi-client/...` reach the siblings because they are materialized **inside** this root.
- Never move the `Dockerfile`/compose back into `mushpi-server/` — the cross-repo `COPY` would no longer reach `mushpi-client/`.
- Never build with the workspace (orchestration root) as the context root. No `.dockerignore` governs that path, so the context balloons and `.env`/sibling checkouts can be swept into the upload.
- **`.dockerignore` has load-bearing entries — never "clean it up" by pattern.** `mushpi-server/` and `mushpi-client/` are the build inputs (`COPY`ed by the Dockerfile) and must **never** be listed there; `release.json` must stay un-ignored. Only the never-built repos (`mushpi-grow`, `mushpi-mock`, `mushpi-docs`) and live state (`data`, `data-test`, `mushpi-data`) belong in that file. To check a change, extract every `COPY`/`ADD` source from the `Dockerfile` and confirm it is not matched — note `git check-ignore` reads `.gitignore`, **not** `.dockerignore`, so it is the wrong tool for this and gives misleading hits (the sibling clones are gitignored by design).

## Yarn Berry 4 / Corepack

- The sub-repos are Yarn Berry 4, not Yarn 1. They pin Yarn via `"packageManager": "yarn@4.14.1"` in each `package.json` and rely on Corepack to run the pinned release. The official `node:*` images ship Yarn 1 **and** remove/disable Corepack, so the Dockerfile must `RUN corepack enable` in **every** stage.
- Never `npm install -g yarn@4`. The `yarn` npm package is Yarn 1; Yarn 2+ is Corepack-only. Without Corepack, `yarn workspaces focus` and `yarn install --immutable` fail.

## `better-sqlite3` native build

- Needs `python3 make g++` in the **runtime** stage only, installed before `yarn workspaces focus --all --production`. Its install script tries a prebuilt binary, then falls back to `node-gyp rebuild`, which needs Python and a C++ compiler.
- The `client-build`/`server-build` stages do **not** need the toolchain — they install full dev dependencies, where prebuilds suffice.

## Client API regeneration + the `tsc` gate

- `mushpi-client/src/api/generated/*` is gitignored, so the client-build stage regenerates it from the committed `mushpi-server/spec/openapi.json` (`yarn gen:client && yarn gen:schemas`). `openapi-generator-cli` needs a JRE (`default-jre-headless`).
- The client's `yarn build` (`tsc`) is a hard gate. If the server's committed spec is missing fields (entities lacking `@ApiProperty`), the regenerated types are incomplete and the build fails. That is a **server contract bug — flag it, don't hack around it**.

## Entrypoint & runtime details

- The server entrypoint is `dist/src/main.js`, not `dist/main.js` — tsc's `rootDir` is the project root because `docs/` and `spec/` are in the compile set. `CMD ["node", "dist/src/main.js"]`.
- `APP_SECRET` is optional (LAN/Tailscale is the auth boundary), which is why the HEALTHCHECK sends no Authorization header.
- `PICO_ANNOUNCE_SECRET` is required in production and belongs in `.env`.

### Entrypoint & data directory

- The runtime `ENTRYPOINT` is `scripts/docker-entrypoint.sh`. The image has **no `USER` directive** — it starts as root so the entrypoint can fix a host bind-mount the Docker daemon created as `root` (a fresh clone has no `./mushpi-data`, and the daemon creates a missing bind-mount source root-owned). It then drops privileges and `exec`s the CMD as `node` (UID/GID 1000, matching Raspberry Pi OS's default `pi` user).
- As root it `mkdir -p`s `/data`, `/data/images` and `/data/logs`, and for each one — only when the top-level owner is not already `node:node` — runs `chown -R node:node`. The `stat` guard keeps the recursive walk off the steady-state restart path.
- A failed `chown` (read-only mount, or a filesystem that maps root to an unprivileged user such as NFS `root_squash`) exits 1 telling the operator to pre-create the directory as UID/GID 1000 on the host.
- Ownership alone is not trusted: the entrypoint verifies `/data` is writable *as `node`* (`setpriv … test -w`) before dropping, so a permission surprise fails loudly instead of surfacing inside the app.
- **Do not "simplify" this back to an assert-only guard.** The earlier never-chown version made `docker compose up` fail on every fresh clone — the reported first-run bug.
- Unprivileged starts stay guarded: `docker run --user <non-root>` skips the root branch, and an unwritable/root-owned `/data` exits 1 with the host remedy `sudo chown -R <uid>:<gid> <MUSHPI_DATA_DIR>`.
- No-volume fallback: run the image with no `/data` mount and the baked tree (created and owned in the runtime stage) still passes — `docker run ghcr.io/mushroom-pi/mushpi` boots fine for smoke tests; data just doesn't persist.
- An override command passed to `docker run` (e.g. `docker run … bash`) is still guarded: ownership is fixed, privileges dropped, then it is `exec`ed.
- **Consequence of the root start: `docker exec` now lands as root, not `node`.** PID 1 still runs as `node`; only the exec default changed. Pass `--user node` when it matters.

## `APP_HTTPS_ENABLED` (browser-facing HTTPS)

- Interpolated from `.env` and passed **into** the container as `APP_HTTPS_ENABLED: ${APP_HTTPS_ENABLED:-false}`. Unlike `MUSHPI_DATA_DIR`/`MUSHPI_IMAGE_TAG` it is a runtime env var, not interpolation-only. It declares the browser-facing deployment; it does **not** configure TLS.
- Keep it `false` (the default) for any plain-HTTP deployment — a LAN Pi is one. When `true`, the server sends `Strict-Transport-Security` and retains the CSP `upgrade-insecure-requests` directive; when `false` it sends neither.
- **On an HTTP deployment `true` breaks the UI.** `upgrade-insecure-requests` makes the browser rewrite the SPA's own asset URLs to `https://` with no HTTP fallback, so the page renders blank white with no API calls and the console reports `SSL_ERROR_RX_RECORD_TOO_LONG` (TLS spoken to a plaintext port). Browsers exempt `localhost` as a trustworthy origin, which is why it bites a LAN hostname/IP but not local dev.
- Set it `true` only when TLS is genuinely terminated in front (Tailscale Serve, a reverse proxy) or served directly.
- Server-side detail (the schema flag, the middleware, the HSTS/CSP gating) lives in `mushpi-server/REFERENCE.md`.

## Rate limiting (`MAX_REQUESTS` / `MAX_REQUESTS_TIME`)

- Throttling is **opt-in**: it registers only when **both** vars are set as positive integers — `MAX_REQUESTS` (requests per window) and `MAX_REQUESTS_TIME` (window length in **milliseconds**). Recommended starting values `MAX_REQUESTS=300` / `MAX_REQUESTS_TIME=60000` (≈5 req/s sustained per client IP), shipped commented out in `.env.example`. With the pair absent the server registers no throttler: no 429s and **no `X-RateLimit-*` headers at all**. Setting **only one** is a configuration error — the server fails at boot rather than half-configuring the guard.
- The pair is **deliberately not hard-coded** in `docker-compose.yml` or the `Dockerfile`: a hard default would silently override the server's opt-in design with no clean off switch, and would surface as unexplained 429s on the dashboard's read endpoints. Activation is operator-side only — compose passes `.env` through the service's `env_file`, so uncommenting the pair in `.env` is the entire mechanism.
- The tracker is **per client IP, per container instance**: in-memory, resets on restart/redeploy, not shared across replicas.
- The server does **not** enable Express `trust proxy`, so behind a reverse proxy every client appears to come from the proxy's IP and shares one bucket — size the limit accordingly, or leave the pair unset.
- Route scope: `/health` is always exempt (`@SkipThrottle()`), so the container HEALTHCHECK can never be rate limited; `/ping` and the `/v1/*` application routes are throttled only when the pair is configured.
- Server-side detail (the Joi pair validation, the throttler factory, the guard and header semantics) lives in `mushpi-server/REFERENCE.md`.

## `release.json` in the build context

- The client-build stage bakes `__APP_RELEASE_VERSION__` into the SPA from `release.json` (the sidebar footer). Keep **both** halves: `COPY release.json /app/release.json` in the Dockerfile **and** `release.json` absent from `.dockerignore`.
- Breaking either half fails **silently** — the image still builds, but the footer shows its `dev` fallback with no build error. The two halves are coupled.

## Tag & CI semantics

- **Neither publish workflow has ever actually executed.** No `v*` tag has been cut and `release.json` is still pre-1.0, so `publish.yml` has never run and `publish-dev.yml` is brand new. CI edits are therefore **unverified until a real run**: a wrong action owner (`actions/setup-qemu-action` instead of `docker/setup-qemu-action`) sat undetected in `publish.yml` from the day it was written. Verify every `uses:` owner against the registry (`git ls-remote --tags https://github.com/<owner>/<repo> refs/tags/<tag>`) rather than trusting the file's own history, and remember `actionlint` cannot lint composite actions.

- The image name is `ghcr.io/${{ github.repository_owner }}/mushpi`, deliberately decoupled from this repo's name. Renaming this repo does **not** rename the published image; changing the image name is a deliberate product decision, not a side effect of a repo rename.
- A `vX.Y.Z` tag pins only **this repo's** files (Dockerfile, compose, CI, `release.json`). Sub-repos build at their **default-branch HEAD**, not at any ref the tag records — so sub-repo release commits (including `mushpi-mock`) must be pushed **before** the tag.
- On tag builds CI checks out all four sub-repos and runs `scripts/verify-release.sh` (the parity check), which cross-checks the manifest against each sub-repo's committed version. Grow and mock are checked out solely so that check can run; they never enter the image.
- **`latest` is emitted by two independent mechanisms — changing one and not the other surprises you.** `publish.yml` passes metadata-action `flavor: latest=auto` (the action's default; it now travels through the shared composite action), which generates `latest` for tag-type rules — so a `v*` tag push moves `latest` on its own. The workflow's explicit `type=raw,value=latest` rule covers pushes to `main`, and its condition is bound **by ref** (`github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'`) rather than to the repository's default-branch setting — so which branch is the default cannot enable or disable it.

## Dev / pre-release image builds

- `publish-dev.yml` is `workflow_dispatch`-only. Inputs: `ops_ref` (default `main`), `server_ref`/`client_ref` (blank = that repo's default branch), a required free-form `image_tag`, and `push` (default true; false = build without pushing — multi-platform cannot `load`, so nothing is exported).
- Tag rules: `latest` and a strict `vX.Y.Z` (or `X.Y.Z`) are rejected so a dev run can never be mistaken for a release; pre-release forms (`0.9.0-rc1`) pass. Every build also gets `dev-sha-<short>` (metadata-action concatenates `prefix=dev-sha-` with the 7-char SHA verbatim). `flavor: latest=false` guarantees `latest` is never emitted.
- The release-manifest guard and `scripts/verify-release.sh` are deliberately skipped — a dev build is not a bundle release.
- Run a dev image on the Pi: set `MUSHPI_IMAGE_TAG=<tag>` in `.env`, then `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`.
- Pre-release convention: an `0.9.0-rc1` image is a test candidate only; the actual release is cut by the `v0.9.0` git tag plus the `release.json` bump through `publish.yml`. Never retag an rc image as the release — rebuild on the tag.
- Cleanup of dev tags is **manual only** (no scheduled workflow, no retention policy): delete stale versions in the GHCR package UI or API.

## Shared build action (`.github/actions/build-image`)

- The composite action is **deliberately dumb**: toolchain setup, login, metadata, build/push only. **Callers own triggers, guards and tag policy** — each workflow passes its own `registry`/`image_name` (from its `env`), `token`, `push`, `flavor` and `tags`. That explicit local policy is what guarantees a dev build cannot move `latest`. **Never add a `mode: release|dev` input, or any ref/branch logic, to the action.**
- `flavor` and `tags` are **required** inputs. `publish.yml` passes `latest=auto` (metadata-action's default; a `v*` tag push moves `latest`), `publish-dev.yml` passes `latest=false`.
- Composite actions cannot reliably read the `secrets` context — the token arrives as the `token` input (`token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` from each caller; both keep `packages: write`). `push` is a string: the action compares `inputs.push == 'true'`.
- `.gitignore` allowlists `.github/actions/**` explicitly (mirroring `!.github/workflows/**`). A new file under `.github/actions/` that falls outside that pattern is silently uncommittable, which breaks both workflows in CI.
- actionlint lints the two workflows but **not** the action file — it parses explicit file arguments as workflows (rhysd/actionlint#401).

## Local verify/build prerequisites

- `scripts/verify-release.sh` and a local `docker build` need **bash, git, and jq** (the script parses JSON with `jq`), plus GNU `grep`/`sort`. Windows contributors run under **WSL**.
- Materialize the four siblings as transient clones **inside this repo** (they are gitignored — never vendored):
  ```bash
  for r in mushpi-server mushpi-client mushpi-grow mushpi-mock; do
    git clone https://github.com/mushroom-pi/$r.git
  done
  ```
  A local verify can instead clone from working trees. Plain self-hosting needs none of this.

## `docker-compose.override.yml` & local `.env`

- `docker-compose.override.yml` is untracked by design: it switches compose from pulling the published image to building locally. Self-hosters' clones never contain it.
- Copy `.env.example` → `.env` before a local `docker compose up`. `.env` is gitignored and never committed.
- **A local build can silently run a stale published image.** In build mode the image is tagged from the base file's `image:` field, so if `MUSHPI_IMAGE_TAG` names a tag already present locally (e.g. a pulled `0.9.0-alpha`), `docker compose up -d` skips the rebuild and starts the old image. Use a private tag for local verification (or force the rebuild) so you are testing the tree you built.
